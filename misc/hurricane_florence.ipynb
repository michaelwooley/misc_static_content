    "It is possible for hurricanes to throw off employment counts if they cause workers to miss work. While shutdowns due to this factor are important, they can generate large distortions in the data that need to be distinguished from other transitory and secular factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employment in the Establishment Survey (the source of headline employment) is tallied as the number of people on establishment payrolls during _any part_ of the week on which the 12th of the month falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Hurricane Florence is on path to make landfall at early Wednesday at the earliest. In North Carolina mandatory evacuations of the Outer Banks area were ordered at [noon Monday](https://weather.com/safety/hurricane/news/2018-09-10-hurricane-florence-preparations-southeast-coast-north-carolina). Voluntary evacuations of UNC-Wilmington were to begin on noon Monday. At around 3pm EDT evacuations of the coastal area of South Carolina were [ordered to begin at noon Tuesday](https://www.postandcourier.com/news/evacuations-ordered-for-sc-coast-as-hurricane-florence-nears-effective/article_ecae59d2-b507-11e8-b430-c30c881683a8.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest in \"Emergency Evacuation\" at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&geo=US-NC&q=%2Fm%2F058th7) only began to pick up in the mid-afternoon in both South and North Carolina. There do not appear to be any major traffic jams on _outgoing_ highways in the evacuation areas as of 6pm EDT. This suggests that evacuations have yet to begin in earnest. There does appear to be regular rush-hour traffic in and around the major metro areas of Charleston, Myrtle Beach, and Wilmington. This suggests that most people were at work today.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this evidence leads me to infer that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Few people evacuated on Monday.\n",
    "    - Timing of evacuation orders.\n",
    "    - Lack of traffic jams.\n",
    "    - Several days until earliest landfall.\n",
    "1. Most people went to work on Monday.\n",
    "    - Inferred lack of evacuations.\n",
    "    - Rush hour traffic.\n",
    "1. **(Therefore,) The effect of Florence on reported September employement in the Carolinas (and the greater U.S.) will be negligible.**\n",
    "    - Inferred that most people worked Monday.\n",
    "    - People who worked on Monday will be counted in payroll and, therefore, as employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I discuss one example of a hurricane that did significantly affect employment (Irma) and one example of a hurricane that did not affect employment (Charley). Both hurricanes occurred around the week of the 12th of the month. However, Irma evacuations began in earnest on the weekend before employment counts while Charley evacuations did not occur until later in the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Florence did affect employment significantly, it would probably have to be in October. However, this would only happen if Florence is so devastating that large parts of the economy are still shut down in the following month. This was the case with Hurricane Katrina, which is discussed last.\n"
